# The Accidental Developer

## Did you just got your first job as a developer? Congrats! 
    Were you overwhelmed with all the acronyms, backronyms, and marketing hype?
A brief, useful, and mostly correct guide to modern software development
## in general, try to reference good, broad sources

### How **you** too can prevent data breaches

Security 

Have a brief run-down of each of the core concepts. Why this is important for users of your software. Also include security analysis and profiles, if it is an intranet site vs. a public site, how to analyze 
- Sql injection
- OWASP top 10 lists
- no default or password-less accounts
- [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)

### Testing your Testers

- LOGGING

### SQL and No-Sql, ORMs, Tuples and relational databases, oh my!

- brief comparison, especially how while no-sql DBs have their place, SQL the language is increasingly adopted by those platforms

### Source control for the Lazy and Dumb

- what it does and why it is so darn useful
- Git, the de facto current best
- other source control systems out in the wild:
  - TFS
  - mercurial
  - CVS, DCVS
  - perforce - sucks but usable
  - VSS - push to get rid of this ASAP, it has issues where it can become corrupted

### Operating systems and Containers, Virtual Machines  - Why what you think you know is not how it is 

- Hardware: SSD and hard drives, memory, cpu and OOE and caches
- OS - broad jobs they do and why this is useful
- VM: virtualizing OS so that multiple can be run on the same host system. Important for t  
- Containerization

### A Bit About Bits and Bytes

- crash intro to character encodings
- otherwise, advice that bit and byte level details will usually not come up often, but this can still be important

### Interpersonal skills

Sure, you can create binary trees from arrays with the best of them, but can you treat your teammates with respect?

- Code reviews for dummies []
- Practice:
- Preach:
- Avoid: [Fear-Driven Development](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/FearDrivenDevelopmentFDD.aspx)

### Programming Languages - Everything you need to know from the safety of your Armchair

- Ophidiophobia, gemophilia, and why languages trigger emotional responses
- purity and impurity
- immutability
- asynchronous vs parallel - when should the two be used?
- diversification of knowledge - why learning Haskell and C is good for you even if there ain't so many jobs
- OOP, FP, Imperative, Flop
- a word of advice - choose a language or two that allows you to be productive, and remember that it is perfectly fine to spend more time learning a "harder" language or the finer points of your job's main languages, considering how very long you will likely be using it for

### Miscellaneous

- Keyboard skills! Learn those valuable shortcuts for navigating text-based systems
  - tab for autocomplete
  - ctrl and other common ways to navigate and manipulate text

- how to remain foc, uh... what? sorry, tweet popped up
